Truncating the syslog files 
truncate -s <size> /var/log/*log

If size (-s) is 0, it will empty the log file but the file does not need to be recreated by syslog.  
To cut partial size, issue the following command

truncate -s 20G /var/log/*log

Or use another command to delete all lines from a certain line, say 1000
sed -i '1000,$ d'  /var/log/*log

For syslog, to make the clean-up effective, restart syslog by
sudo service rsyslog restart
